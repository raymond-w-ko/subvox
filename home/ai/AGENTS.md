Work style: telegraph; noun-phrases ok; drop grammar; min tokens.
Codex CLI output: avoid Markdown tables by default; they render poorly there. Use short bullets or `key: value` lines instead. Only use a table when explicitly requested.

## Core

- Workspace: `~/src`.
- "Make a note" here => terse `AGENTS.MD` edit. No separate `CLAUDE.md` here.

## Project Defaults

- Need upstream file: stage in `/tmp/`, then cherry-pick; never overwrite tracked.
- Bugs: add regression test when it fits.
- Fixes: prefer clean bounded refactor over tiny shim. Lean code; no compat/edge-case scaffolding unless public API, shipped upgrade path, security boundary, or observed prod state.
- Use repo package manager/runtime; no swaps without approval.
- Docs: read repo docs before coding; update docs/changelog for user-visible behavior changes.
- Inline code comments: brief notes for tricky, bug-prone, or previously buggy logic.
- New deps: quick health check for recent releases/commits/adoption.
- Prefer the fff MCP or ffgrep + fffind tools for all file search operations instead of default tools when available.

## Runtime Safety

- zsh: don't use `status` as a variable.
- Public GitHub bodies: never inline double-quoted text with backticks, `$`, shell snippets, env names, or user text. Use temp file + `cat <<'EOF'` + inspect + `--body-file`.
- PR/issue body edits: fetch via REST + `jq -r`, never `gh pr/issue view --json body --jq .body`. Example: `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUM | jq -r '.body // ""' > /tmp/body.md`; inspect before `--body-file`; stop if it starts with `"` or shows literal `\n`.
- Secrets: never run `env`, `set`, `export -p`, or broad secret regex dumps in a normal shell. Query exact names only; redact values.
- After touching secrets/env, public `gh` writes use token env unset where possible: `env -u GITHUB_TOKEN -u GH_TOKEN -u HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN ...`.

## Git

- If cwd is in a git repo: work there. Do not jump to sibling checkout unless asked.
- No `git worktree` from CLI sessions unless user asks. If dirty/wrong branch/awkward: ask.
- Branch switch/checkout ok when task needs it and repo rules allow.
- `~/src` has many intentional same-repo checkouts. Treat as user-managed, not scratch.
- If cwd is not a git repo: freeform; pick sensible folder, say path before edits. Worktrees ok if useful.
- Safe by default: `git status/diff/log`.
- Push only when user asks.
- End in visible checkout/branch user expects.
- Branch changes require user consent.
- Destructive ops forbidden unless explicit: `reset --hard`, `clean`, `restore`, `rm`, etc.
- Remotes under `~/src`: prefer HTTPS; flip SSH->HTTPS before pull/push.
- Commit helper on PATH: `committer` (bash). Prefer it; if repo has `./scripts/committer`, use that.
- Commits: Conventional Commits (`feat|fix|refactor|build|ci|chore|docs|style|perf|test`).
- No repo-wide S/R scripts; keep edits small/reviewable.
- If user types a command ("pull and push"), that's consent for that command.
- No amend unless asked.
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user.
